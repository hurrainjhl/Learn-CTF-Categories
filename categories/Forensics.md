## Phase 1: Understand the Basics

### What is Forensics in CTFs?
- Analyzing digital artifacts such as:
  - Disk images.
  - Memory dumps.
  - Network traffic captures (PCAP files).
  - Logs and metadata.
  - Media files (images, audio, video).
- Common tasks:
  - Recovering hidden or deleted files.
  - Extracting metadata or embedded data.
  - Reconstructing timelines and events.

### Types of Forensics Challenges
- **File Analysis**: Identifying hidden or corrupted data.
- **Steganography**: Finding hidden messages in images, audio, or video.
- **Memory Forensics**: Analyzing volatile memory dumps.
- **Network Forensics**: Examining PCAP files for evidence.
- **Disk Forensics**: Investigating file systems and disk images.

### Set Up a Lab Environment
- Use a virtual machine or dedicated system for analysis.
- Install tools and forensic software (listed below).

  - **binwalk**: Analyze file contents for hidden data.

### File Format Basics
- Understand common file formats and their signatures:
  - Images: PNG, JPEG, BMP.
  - Archives: ZIP, RAR, tar.gz.
  - Executables: ELF, PE, Mach-O.
- Use file identification tools:
  - **file** command in Linux.
  - **TrID**: File type identifier.

### Extract and Analyze Metadata
- Metadata often contains useful clues like creation date, GPS location, or authorship.
- Tools:
  - **ExifTool**: Extract metadata from images, documents, and media.
  - **strings**: Extract readable strings from binary files.

---

## Phase 3: Learn Steganography

### Identify Steganographic Techniques
- Hidden data in files:
  - Extra bytes in image/audio/video files.
  - Manipulated least significant bits (LSB).
- Common tools:
  - **stegsolve**: Analyze and manipulate image layers.
  - **zsteg**: Detect hidden data in PNG and BMP files.
  - **stegseek**: Bruteforce password-protected steganographic files.

### Practice Manual Stego Analysis
- Check for anomalies:
  - File size or structure.
  - Unusual data appended to files.
- Use steganography detection websites/tools to gain experience.

---

## Phase 4: Learn Disk and File System Forensics

### Disk Image Analysis
- Learn to mount and analyze disk images:
  - Look for deleted or hidden files.
  - Identify file system types (FAT, NTFS, EXT).
- Tools:
  - **Autopsy**: Comprehensive forensic tool.
  - **Sleuth Kit (TSK)**: Command-line tools for disk analysis.
  - **FTK Imager**: Disk imaging and analysis.

### File Recovery Techniques
- Recover deleted files using:
  - **foremost**: File recovery tool.
  - **photorec**: Recovers files by signature.

### Understand Common Artifacts
- Learn where important data is stored:
  - Windows: Registry, Event Logs, Prefetch files.
  - Linux: `.bash_history`, log files.

---

## Phase 5: Learn Memory Forensics

### Basics of Memory Dumps
- Memory dumps often contain:
  - Credentials.
  - Running processes.
  - Open files and network connections.

### Memory Forensic Tools
- **Volatility Framework**: Analyze memory dumps for processes, DLLs, or connections.
- **Rekall**: Another memory analysis tool.

### Practice Common Memory Forensic Tasks
- Extract passwords, open files, or suspicious processes.
- Tools like **strings** can quickly search for readable data.

---

## Phase 6: Learn Network Forensics

### Analyze PCAP Files
- PCAP files capture network traffic.
- Learn to:
  - Extract credentials or flags from network traffic.
  - Reconstruct file transfers.
- Tools:
  - **Wireshark**: GUI tool for analyzing network traffic.
  - **tcpdump**: Command-line packet analyzer.

### Reassemble Files from Traffic
- Reconstruct files from HTTP, FTP, or SMTP traffic.
- Tools:
  - **NetworkMiner**: Passive network forensic analysis.
  - **foremost**: Recover files from traffic dumps.

### Understand Protocols
- Focus on commonly used protocols:
  - HTTP, HTTPS.
  - DNS, FTP, SMTP, POP3.
