## Phase 1: Build the Foundations

### Understand the Basics of Cryptography
- **Types of Cryptography**:
  - Symmetric Encryption (e.g., AES, DES).
  - Asymmetric Encryption (e.g., RSA, ECC).
  - Hashing (e.g., SHA-256, MD5).
- **Cryptographic Goals**:
  - Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Non-repudiation.
- **Mathematical Background**:
  - Modular arithmetic, Prime numbers, Factorization, GCD, LCM.

**Resources:**
- Khan Academy (Basic cryptography concepts, modular arithmetic).
- *The Code Book* by Simon Singh.

## Phase 2: Explore Classic Ciphers

### Learn Classical Encryption Methods
- **Substitution Ciphers**: Caesar, VigenÃ¨re, Affine.
- **Transposition Ciphers**: Rail Fence, Columnar.
- **Other Classics**: Playfair, Enigma.

**Practice:**
- Decrypt messages manually.
- Automate decryption using Python.

**Tools:**
- [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/)
- Cryptohack challenges.

---

## Phase 3: Modern Cryptographic Techniques

### Symmetric Cryptography
- Block ciphers (AES), Modes (ECB, CBC, GCM).
- Stream ciphers (RC4) and weaknesses.

### Asymmetric Cryptography
- RSA: Key generation, encryption/decryption, vulnerabilities.
- ECC: Basics and its advantages.

### Hashing
- Purpose, weaknesses, and common attacks (MD5/SHA-1 collisions).

---

## Phase 4: Exploit Cryptographic Vulnerabilities

### Attack Techniques
- **Classical Attacks**: Frequency analysis, Known-plaintext attacks.
- **Modern Attacks**:
  - Padding Oracle Attacks.
  - RSA Attacks (Wiener's, Common modulus, Small `e`).
  - Timing attacks, Side-channel attacks.

### Practice Implementing and Exploiting
- Write Python scripts for weak ciphers.
- Use `pycryptodome` for encryption/decryption.
