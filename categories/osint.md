## Phase 1: Understanding OSINT

### What is OSINT?
- OSINT involves collecting publicly available information from various sources such as websites, social media, forums, and public records.
- Key skills:
  - Investigating people, organizations, or digital artifacts.
  - Identifying patterns, links, and hidden connections.

### Familiarize Yourself with OSINT Use Cases
- **CTF Challenges**: Identifying hidden information on websites, finding usernames or emails, or solving puzzles using public data.
- **Real-world Applications**: Cybersecurity, law enforcement, journalism.

### Set Up an OSINT Environment
- Use a separate machine or VM for OSINT tasks for privacy and security.
- Install necessary tools and browsers (e.g., Firefox with privacy add-ons, Tor).

## Phase 2: Learn the Basics

### Web Search Techniques
- Master **Google Dorking**:
  - Use search operators to find specific information.
    - Example: `site:example.com filetype:pdf confidential`.
  - Learn operators like `intitle:`, `inurl:`, `ext:`, and `cache:`.
- Use search engines like DuckDuckGo and Bing for additional perspectives.

### Understand Metadata
- Learn how metadata can provide useful clues (e.g., author, timestamp, GPS coordinates).
- Tools:
  - **ExifTool**: Extract metadata from images and files.
  - **Metadata2Go**: Online metadata viewer.

### Social Media Investigation
- Explore how to gather data from platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
- Use tools to scrape or analyze profiles (while respecting terms of service).
- **Resources**:
  - Search for usernames across platforms using tools like [Namechk](https://namechk.com/).

## Phase 3: Master OSINT Tools

### Key Tools for OSINT
- **Maltego**: Visualize relationships between entities (e.g., people, domains, IPs).
- **Recon-ng**: A modular OSINT framework for automated reconnaissance.
- **SpiderFoot**: Automated data collection and analysis.
- **Shodan**: Find information about IoT devices and vulnerable systems.
- **theHarvester**: Gather information like emails, subdomains, and open ports.
- **Amass**: For DNS enumeration and asset discovery.
- **Metagoofil**: Extract metadata from documents.

### Image and Geolocation Tools
- **Google Reverse Image Search** and **Yandex Reverse Image Search**.
- **EXIF Extractors**: For geolocation data.
- **Geolocating Images**:
  - [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) (practice identifying locations).
  - [GeoTips](https://geotips.net/) for geographic clues.

## Phase 4: Develop Specific OSINT Skills

### Domain and IP Investigations
- Use tools like `whois` to identify domain ownership.
- Investigate IP addresses with tools like MaxMind GeoIP and ipinfo.io.

### Email and Username Investigation
- Find email breaches or leaks using tools like:
  - [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
  - [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/).

### Social Media Deep Dives
- Track activity using:
  - Twitter advanced search.
  - Tools like Twint for scraping Twitter data.

### Analyze Digital Artifacts
- Extract hidden clues from digital content like:
  - Images: Look for steganography or hidden data.
  - Documents: Analyze metadata or embedded links.

## Phase 5: Practice OSINT Challenges

### Beginner-Friendly Challenges
- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/)
- [CTFtime.org](https://ctftime.org/)
- [CyberSecLabs](https://cyberseclabs.co.uk/)

### Interactive Platforms
- [Trace Labs](https://www.tracelabs.org/)
- [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/)

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Techniques

### Automate OSINT
- Write scripts in Python using `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, or `selenium`.
- Use APIs:
  - Twitter API for social media data.
  - Shodan API for device discovery.

### Stay Anonymous
- Learn OPSEC techniques (use VPNs, Tor, burner accounts).

---

## Phase 7: Participate and Share

### Join OSINT Communities
- Participate in Discord communities or subreddits focused on OSINT.
- Collaborate with others on challenges or investigations.

### Write and Publish
- Document your OSINT processes in blogs or write-ups.
- Create educational content, tutorials, or tools to help others.
